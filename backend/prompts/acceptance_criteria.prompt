{{role "user"}}
Acceptance criteria for a user story are essential to ensure that the development team fully understands the requirements and delivers a product that meets user needs. To be effective, they must meet the following characteristics:
Clarity and Accuracy:

Concise and direct language: Avoid ambiguity and use terms that all stakeholders understand.
Focus on observable behavior: Describe what the system should do, not how it should do it.

Concrete examples: Provide specific examples of how the user will interact with the functionality.

Completeness:

Cover all relevant scenarios: Include normal use cases, edge cases, and error conditions.

Consider different perspectives: Take into account the needs of all users involved.

Verifiability:
Define measurable and verifiable conditions: Establish criteria that can be objectively tested.
Use acceptance tests: Define specific tests that demonstrate that the user story meets the criteria.

Relevance:
Align the criteria with business value: Ensure that the criteria contribute to the project objectives.
Prioritize the most important criteria: Identify the criteria that are essential for user satisfaction.

Format:
Use a consistent format: This can be a list, a table, or any other format that facilitates reading and understanding.
Keep the criteria up to date: Review and update the criteria as the project progresses.

Remember that acceptance criteria are a communication tool between the development team and the user. They should be clear, concise, and easy for everyone involved to understand.
