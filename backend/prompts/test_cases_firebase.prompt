Generate multiple steps for a software test case based on:
- User Story: {{userStory}}
- Description: {{description}}
- Acceptance Criteria:
{{#each acceptanceCriterias}}
- {{criteria}}
{{/each}}

Each step should focus on a specific, atomic action and its expected outcome and will be given to an Agent Testing

Use the following structure:

---
**Test Case Step Generation Request:**

**1. Goal (Mandatory):** What is the primary, concise objective of this step? (e.g., "Wait for loading screen", "Select X as Y", "Verify form submission")

**2. Hint (Optional):** Provide any additional context, specific user actions, or helper information for executing this step. Think of it as a detailed instruction or prerequisite. (e.g., "Wait for 15 seconds", "Click on 'Continue' button", "Enter valid credentials")

**3. Success Criteria (Optional but highly recommended):** What is the observable, verifiable outcome that indicates this step was successful? Be specific about what should be visible, functional, or what state the system should be in. (e.g., "Home screen is visible with two options", "User is redirected to dashboard", "Error message 'Invalid input' is displayed")

---

**Example of a good prompt for a step:**
Goal: User logs in
Hint: Enter username 'testuser' and password 'password123'. Click 'Login' button.
Success Criteria: User is redirected to dashboard. Welcome message 'Hello, testuser!' is visible.
and so on...
